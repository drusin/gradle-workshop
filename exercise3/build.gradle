1. Script plugins
- apply the "calcPlugin.gradle" plugin from this folder
- try to run the "calculate" task

2. Custom task types
- Create a custom task type named "Addition" that adds two integers (class Addition extends DefaultTask {...})
- Create an "Addition" task without modifcations (task unmodAddition (type: Addition) and run it
- Create an "Addition" task where you modify the input and run it
