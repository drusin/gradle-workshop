/*
TODO:
1. implement the logic for "calculate"
- add "firstLeft" and "firstRight" and assign the result to "first"
- do the same with second
- print the difference between "first" and "second"
- split the addition and substraction to "doFirst" and "doLast"
- run it

2. create a new task "randomize"
- it should assign random values between 0 and 20 to "firstLeft", "firstRight", "secondLeft", "secondRight"
- run it before calculate manually to see it works (gradlew randomize calculate)
- use dependency control to always have it run before calculate (see https://docs.gradle.org/4.0/dsl/org.gradle.api.Task.html#org.gradle.api.Task:dependsOn(java.lang.Object[]) for help)
